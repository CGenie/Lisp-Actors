**Reppy Channels - adapted for Actors**

While Actors are inherently asynchronous, John Reppy's Channels and Events are aimed specifically at synchronous communications between threads. The huge advantage of John Reppy's Channels is that events and handlers are composable in an FPL sense. You can make some very elaborate multi-channel interfaces among multiple threads.

But with CPS style (=BIND, etc.) you can have Actors join into the fun. This code base is more of my exploratorium for Lisp. While my Actors code has seen production level field testing, my Reppy Channels really have not. But they have been evolving since the early 2000's after I first read John Reppy's CML.
