;; system. Every Actor already has a message queue that serializes
;; requests for service.

;; continue to dispatch messages to remain lively.
;;
;; We default to shared par-safe behavior because SERIALIZERs are
;; frequently used for shared access to a resource. And since we use
;; BECOME, we have to make the SERIALIZER have par-safe behavior.
;;
;; As with PAR-SAFE and IO, any cust args should be fully specified
;; sponsored-actors.
