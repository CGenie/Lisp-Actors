rnc-color-stretch on Mac OSX

Macs are similar to the linux install above as OSX is unix. On Macs
copy the dounloaded rnc-color-stretch file to /usr/local/bin and
change the protection to execute:

cp rnc-color-stretch-v0.936-mac /usr/local/bin/rnc-color-stretch 
chmod 555 /usr/local/bin/rnc-color-stretch

You may need administrator privilege to run the above two commands.
You can do the above commands from a command line, or use a file
browser.

Example: do the above copy command as administrator:

sudo cp rnc-color-stretch-v0.93 /usr/local/bin/rnc-color-stretch 
sudo chmod 555 /usr/local/bin/rnc-color-stretch

Be sure when you download davinci from ASU, you follow their
instructions. Also install xquartz as instructed on the davinci
download page.

On Macs, davinci gets installed in /Applications/davinci.app/Contents/Resources/bin so you need to add
/Applications/davinci.app/Contents/Resources/bin to your PATH.

Confirm your path to executable programs includes /usr/local/bin and
/Applications/davinci.app/Contents/Resources/bin from a terminal
window:

echo $path 
or
echo $PATH 

If /usr/local/bin and /Applications/davinci.app/Contents/Resources/bin
are not in the path, you will need to add it (google for your
particular shell).

For bash shell, edit the file .bash_profile in your home directory (~/.bash_profile).
Append PATH=$PATH:/Applications/davinci.app/Contents/Resources/bin to the file.
save the file
Then on the command line, run:
echo $PATH 
which gives something like:
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/X11/bin:/Applications/davinci.app/Contents/Resources/bin

Depending on which shell you are running, you may need to update the
hash list of commands you can execute. For example, with csh or tcsh,
execute: rehash and the new command will be available for your use.

Confirm davinci runs. From a terminal window, type:
davinci
and if you get the davinci prompt:
dv>
type:
exit()
to exit davinci.
Confirm the new programs will run. From you terminal window (command window) type:
rnc-color-stretch
and you should get information on running the program and a list of options.

To use the program, use a terminal window to cd to the directory where
your image is located and run the command: rnc-color-stretch
yourfile.tif options

See the example use pages at the top of this article.

Install Issues on Some Macs

On some macs it is not obvious (to me) how to get finder to see system directories like /usr/local/bin/, even after following some guides on the internet. On one mac, the path included /usr/local/bin/, but the directory did not exist. You can add this by hand. Open a terminal and run the following commands.

ls -l /usr/local/bin # lists the direcotry. Complains if it does not exist.

If it does not exist:

sudo mkdir /usr/local # sudo is administator--you will need your password mkdir makes the directory.
sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin
The copy the script to /usr/local/bin:
sudo cp rnc-color-stretch-v0.937-mac /usr/local/bin/rnc-color-stretch
sudo chmod 555 /usr/local/bin/rnc-color-stretch
Now edit .bash_profile in your home directory (~ = home directory):

open -t ~/.bash_profile

and add at the end of the file the line:
PATH=$PATH:/Applications/davinci.app/Contents/Resources/bin
save and close the file.

Change directory to your image (command = cd). For example,
cd /disk1/photos/m31
pwd # print working directory
The tab key will help complete directory and file names to save typing.

Once you have cd'd to your directory, simply run the command
rnc-color-stretch filename.tif with added options.
