Dynamic state restoration using =HANDLERs with =BIND.

=BIND has the syntax: =BIND args form &body body

The body code is wrapped into a continuation closure, and form is
executed directly. The form should return via =VALUES which invokes
the continuation closure.

Two cases:

  1. =BIND does not exit the dynamic context, and executes the
    continuation within the extant dynamic context.

    In this case, the =VALUES in the form is performed within the
    handler dynamic extent, which causes the body code to execute also
    within the original dynamic envirionment.

    =HANDLER-CASE becomes equivalent to HANDLER-CASE. The original
    handler tags remain visible during the execution of the =BIND body
    code. There is a direct execution path from the top through
    HANDLER-CASE, then through the =BIND form, and finally through the
    =BIND body.

    (define condition my-exit ()
      ((val :reader my-exit-val :initarg :val)))
      
    (=handler-case
       (=bind (x)
           (=values 15)
	 (signal 'my-exit :val x))
      (my-exit (c)
        (my-exit-val c)))
	  
  2. =BIND calls on SPAWN to execute the form in another thread,
    leaving the body code to become executed as a continuation closure
    at some later time. The orignal execution path terminates with
    that spawn.

    (=handler-case
       (=bind (x)
           (spawn-worker (lambda () (=values 15)))
	 (signal my-exit :val x))
      (my-exit (c)
        (my-exit-val c)))

    In this case the handler is exited after the =BIND exits, removing
    the original dynamic context. When the contination closure later
    executes, it needs to reconstruct the dynamic handler chain before
    executing its body code.

==================================

Impossibility of Lexical Tags for Continuation Closures

Consider the following code:

	 (block top
	 	(=bind (x)
		       (=values 15)
		    (return-from top x)))

As long as there is a direct execution path all the way through the
=BIND body code, this BLOCK/RETURN works as expected.

But if the =BIND form spawns off its form to execute in another
thread, the =BIND exits the BLOCK after the spawn event. On later
execution of the =BIND body code in a continuation closure, that BLOCK
tag no longer exists, and the RETURN will fail.

One cannot produce an =BLOCK in the same manner as for the =HANDLERs
because the BLOCK tag needs to be seen in the lexical environment of
the RETURN. The manner of producing the =HANDLERs separates the body
code into a separate lambda closure and becomes passed into a real
handler as a thunk. This would not allow the body code to see a BLOCK
tag if it were done in the same way.
